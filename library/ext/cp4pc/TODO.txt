Configuration
=============

ADDP
====
- Send error responses (if necessary) for unsupported commands.
- Consider supporting commands to configure the iDigi server settings via ADDP.
   - Requires addition of persistent state (would be easy through settings, just not sure if we want to do it.)
- Support configuration commands?

EDP
===
- Support other push methods than HTTP PUT (like the Messaging Facility).
- Support passwords.
- Change to using a thread instead of a state machine with tick?

RCI
===
- Edit query_settings and query_state so developer.idigi.com lists useful information for Device Properties.
- Fully support the do_command target "zigbee"?
- Fix descriptors to match gateways more closely.
- remove file management, unless root folder is specified.

ZigBee

GUI
